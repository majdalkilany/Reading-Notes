# Stacks and Queues

### What is a Stack ? 
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

##### Common terminology for a stack is

* Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed

* Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
 
 * Top - This is the top of the stack.

* IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
 
### Stacks follow these concepts:
* FILO

* First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

 * LIFO
Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.


* Push O(1)
Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

* Pop O(1)
Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.
