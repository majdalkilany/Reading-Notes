## CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. 
It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.

**To get started we have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.**


Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn’t matter. Grid can place them in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange grid with media queries.

*When sizing rows and columns, we can use all the length units we are used to, like px, rem, %, etc, but it also have keywords like min-content, max-content, auto, and perhaps the most useful, fractional units. grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 2fr min-content;.*


We also have access to a function which can help set boundaries for otherwise flexible units. For example to set a column to be 1fr, but shrink no further than 200px: grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(200px, 1fr);.

There is repeat() function, which saves some typing, like making 10 columns: grid-template-columns: repeat(10, 1fr);

Combining all of these things can be extremely powerful, like grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));.

According to the CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1 specification there are 5 animatable grid properties:

grid-gap, grid-row-gap, grid-column-gap as length, percentage, or calc.
grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows as a simple list of length, percentage, or calc, provided the only differences are the values of the length, percentage, or calc components in the list.
REGEX
Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).

Fields of application range from validation to parsing/replacing strings, passing through translating data to other formats and web scraping.

We can actually use this tool in (almost) all programming languages ​​(JavaScript, Java, VB, C #, C / C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Delphi, R, Tcl, and many others) with the slightest distinctions about the support of the most advanced features and syntax versions supported by the engines).

The application fields of regex can be multiple , here a quick list:

Data validation (for example check if a time string i well-formed)
Data scraping (especially web scraping, find all pages that contain a certain set of words eventually in a specific order).
Data wrangling (transform data from “raw” to another format).
String parsing (for example catch all URL GET parameters, capture text inside a set of parenthesis).
String replacement (for example, even during a code session using a common IDE to translate a Java or C# class in the respective JSON object — replace “;” with “,” make it lowercase, avoid type declaration, etc.).
Syntax highlightning, file renaming, packet sniffing and many other applications involving strings (where data need not be textual).
