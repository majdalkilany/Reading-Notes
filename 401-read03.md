# Readings: FileIO & Exceptions


 ## Reading and Writing Files in Python
 
 * What Is a File?
 a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.

 #### File Paths : 
  file path is a string that represents the location of a file. Itâ€™s broken up into three major parts:

1- Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)


2-File Name: the actual name of the file

3- Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

### Opening and Closing a File in Python

we can use the build in function open() to open file 
and its take one argement " the path to the file "

**you should always make sure that an open file is properly closed**

* we can use to ways to close file 
1- try block
2-The second way to close a file is to use the with statement

we can se the second positional argument the sefolt one is 'r'
Other options for modes  :

'r' its for 	Open for reading (default)

'w'	Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first

'rb' or 'wb'	Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)

### Reading and Writing Opened Files .

* .read(size=-1)==> This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read.

* .readline(size=-1) ==> This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read.
* .readlines()==> This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.


### Python Exceptions

#####  Raising an Exception
We can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs. The statement can be complemented with a custom exception.

 **try clause** ==>all statements are executed until an exception
  is encountered

 **expect**==>s used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.

**else** ==>lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause

**finally** enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
