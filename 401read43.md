# Deployment 

#### Vercel (Recommended) 

**The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform from the creators of Next.js. Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & Jamstack deployment and Serverless Functions.**

##### Getting started

1. Sign up to Vercel (no credit card is required).

2. After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket).

3. After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket).

4. After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.



#### Let’s talk about the workflow we recommend using. Vercel supports 
what we call the DPS workflow: Develop, Preview, and Ship:

Develop: Write code in Next.js. Keep the development server running and 
take advantage of React Fast Refresh.


Preview: Every time you push changes to a branch on GitHub / GitLab / 
BitBucket, Vercel automatically creates a new deployment with a unique 
URL. You can view them on GitHub when you open a pull request, or under 
“Preview Deployments” on your project page on Vercel. Learn more about 
it here.


Ship: When you’re ready to ship, merge the pull request to your default 
branch (e.g. master). Vercel will automatically create a production 
deployment.
