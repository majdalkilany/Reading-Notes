# Pandas

**pandas** : is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis


pandas is like Excel in Python: it uses tables (namely DataFrame) and operates transformations on the data. But it can do a lot more.

#### What kind of data does pandas handle?


When using a Python dictionary of lists, the dictionary keys will be used as column headers and the values in each list as columns of the DataFrame   



##### data frame 

A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values, categorical data and more) in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet, a SQL table or the data.frame in R.


* The table has 3 columns, each of them with a column label. The column labels are respectively Name, Age and Sex.

* The column Name consists of textual data with each value a string, the column Age are numbers and the column Sex is textual data.

##### How do I select a subset of a DataFrame?
To select a single column, use square brackets [] with the column name of the column of interest.

Each column in a DataFrame is a Series. As a single column is selected, the returned object is a pandas Series

* **DataFrame.shape** :
 an attribute (remember tutorial on reading and writing, do not use parentheses for attributes) of a pandas Series and DataFrame containing the number of rows and columns: (nrows, ncolumns).
  A pandas Series is 1-dimensional and only the number of rows is returned.


 ##### How do I filter specific rows from a DataFrame?


* To select rows based on a conditional expression, use a 

condition inside the selection brackets [].

#### How to create plots in pandas?Â¶
* To plot a specific column, use the selection method of the 

subset data tutorial in combination with the plot() method. 

Hence, the plot() method works on both Series and DataFrame.


##### How to create new columns derived from existing columns?

* To create a new column, use the [] brackets with the new column name at the left side of the assignment.

#### How to calculate summary statistics?

* The statistic applied to multiple columns of a DataFrame (the selection of two columns return a DataFrame, see the subset data tutorial) is calculated for each numeric column.
