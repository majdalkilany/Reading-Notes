# Object :
## its define as a groub of variables and functions togather and here the variable become as proparties and function become as method ##

**creat an object : there is many way to creat an object and the easiest one and most popular is literal notation also we can do it by using construction notation (firstly creat anew object (construction function object())then creat blank object to add proparties and method in it).**

to accessing an object we use dot notation or square brackets .

Document object model (DOM): its about how the users creat model of HTML and change the content while browser in window .

DOM tree is amodel of webpage its creat amodel for the page and stored in browser memory .

each node is an object with method and proparties and there is attribute nodes and text nodes .
## accessing the DOM tree involves locate the node and use its text content and attributes ,then access that element and work with those element .
_when we need to work with more an element we use DOM queries method and use variable to store the result .
to select individual element we use (gitelementbyId() ,squareselector) and we can select an element by tag name and CSS selector .__
traversing the dom : we can select onother element inrelation to it by using : - parentNode - previosSibling - nextSibling - firstChild - lastChild

we use the inner HTML and DOM manipolation to adding and removing an html content and by using inner html we can update text and markup .
