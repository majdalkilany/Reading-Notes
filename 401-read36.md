### The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received

#### The Advice: Communicate!

The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can 
impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem 

like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to 
demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare 
prior to an interview.

 
#### What Do You Mean Communicate? 
Let’s say you are in the interview and your interviewers throw you a 
whiteboard question. Do you step up to the whiteboard and feverishly start 
solving the problem?

#### Ask About Edge Cases 

It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a 
bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge 
cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer 
hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. That’s 
great — it shows you’re analytical and will work hard to try to prevent 
bugs (which often crop up due to edge cases).



#### Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

* Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
**Stuck? Ask for Help!**


### 7 tips to ace a programming interview

* 1) Take a few minutes.
* 2) Write down the steps of the solution.
