# Node, Express, and APIs
* Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it is a javascript runtime (Javascript runtime refers to where your javascript code is executed when you run it. That said, javascript can be executed on google chrome, in which case your javascript runtime is v8, if on mozilla - it is spidermonkey, if IE - then its chakra and if on node, again its v8).

* JSHint-npm JSHint is a community-driven tool that detects errors and potential problems in JavaScript code. Since JSHint is so flexible, you can easily adjust it in the environment you expect your code to execute. JSHint is open source and will always stay this way. A linting tool helps me avoid silly mistakes when writing JavaScript. Despite my many years of experience, I still type variable names incorrectly, make syntax errors and forget to handle my errors properly. A good linting tool, or a linter, will tell me about this before I waste my time—or worse, my client’s time. A good linting tool can also help make sure a project adheres to a coding standard.

* one of the biggest use cases for Node.js is running JavaScript on the server.
The Node.js Execution Model Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it. If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request. Under the hood, Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.
