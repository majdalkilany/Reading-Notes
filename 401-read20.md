# Django

#### Django : 
 **is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.**

* It can work with any client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format

* Django provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords, avoiding common mistakes like 
putting session information in cookies where it is vulnerable (instead cookies just contain a key, and 
the actual data is stored in the database) or directly storing passwords rather than a password hash

**Scalable:** 

Django uses a component-based “shared-nothing” architecture (each part of the architecture is independent 
of the others, and can hence be replaced or changed if needed).

* Django is written in Python, which runs on many platforms

Django is "somewhat opinionated". It provides a set of components to handle most web development tasks 
and one (or two) preferred ways to use them. However, Django's decoupled architecture means that you can 
usually pick and choose from a number of different options, or add support for completely new ones if 
desired.

* A URL mapper is typically stored in a file named urls.py.

* views.py:
Views are the heart of the web application, receiving HTTP requests from web clients and returning HTTP 
responses. In between, they marshall the other resources of the framework to access databases, render 
templates.

models.py:

* Django web applications manage and query data through Python objects referred to as models. Models   
define 
* the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default 
values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms.

* views.py (generate response): The Django model provides a simple query API for searching the database.

* Template systems allow you to specify the structure of an output document, using placeholders for data 
that will be filled in when a page is generated.
