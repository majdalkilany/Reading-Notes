# Python Scope & the LEGB Rule: Resolving Names in Your Code


In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects 

there are ttwo main scops :

Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

## Names and Scopes in Python

Python is a dynamically-typed language, variables in Python come into existence when you first assign them a value


Python Scope vs Namespace
`
In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the namespace. As you’ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They’re stored in a special attribute called .__dict__.



### Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope


 * Functions: The Local Scope 

 *The local scope or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you’re also creating a new local scope*

 #### Nested Functions: The Enclosing Scope

 Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions. The enclosing scope was added in Python 2.2. It takes the form of the local scope of any enclosing function’s
  local scopes


  #### Modules: The Global Scope : 


From the moment you start a Python program, you’re in the global Python scope. Internally, Python turns your program’s main script into a module called __main__ to hold the main program’s execution. The namespace of this module is the main global scope of your program.

* builtins: The Built-In Scope
