 # Linked Lists
**A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer**

#### Linked types:

* Singly : Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

* Doubly : Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

### Creation of Linked list

A linked list is created by using the node class. We create a Node object and create another class to use this ode object. We pass the appropriate values thorugh the node object to point to the next data elements''

#### Big O

The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.

The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1). This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input.
