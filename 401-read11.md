# JupyterLab : 

* JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

* JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner

* JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.)


# Data Science in a nutshell 


**1, Data acquisition** :
The data could be in the form of .CSV files. Excel file (.XLSX) is a typical form, or it could be available by API calls, or someone has done the dirty work already and they are all in DWH(Data WareHouse) or Data Lake

**2, Data cleaning & wrangling**

Data could be in the nested structure for storage saving purpose (e.g. Bigquery and NoSQL), could be normalized (like general databases). The data need to be flattened before usage.


**3, Data Engineering**
the point of Data Engineering is building a stable and reliable architecture for data storage and consumption. It is a extremely vital part as all kinds of data science tricks depends on it.


**Resources that people in the data science field must know**

Here is the list of the resources one in the field must know:
1, Jupyter Notebook
2, Kaggle
3, Github
4, StackOverflow
5, Data Studio/Tableau
6, Quora
7, Medium
8, Google/DuckDuckGo


## NumPy
* NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem.

* Using NumPy To Read In Files Itâ€™s possible to use NumPy to directly read csv or other files into arrays. We can do this using the numpy.genfromtxt function.

**NumPy has several different data types, which mostly map to Python data types**
