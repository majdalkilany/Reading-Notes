# web scrabing 
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data 
sc
raping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping 

software may access the World Wide Web directly using the 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol, 
or through a web browser. While web 
scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term 
typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot 
or web crawler. It is a form of copying,
 in which specific data 

is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central 
local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.


## Techniques
* Human copy-and-paste

The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. 

Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste,

 and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.

 * Text pattern matching 
 A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web 
 pages can be based on the UNIX grep command or regular 
 
 expression-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance Perl or Python).

* HTTP programming
Static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting HTTP 
requests to the remote web server using socket programming.

* HTML parsing
Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. 

In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a 
particular information source, extracts its content and 
translates it into a relational form, is called a wrapper

* DOM parsing
By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the Internet 
Explorer or the Mozilla browser control, programs can retrieve 
the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These 
browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on 
which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such as 
Xpath can be used to parse the resulting DOM tree.

* Vertical aggregation

There are several companies that have developed vertical specific 
harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a 
multitude of "bots" for specific verticals with no "man in the 
loop" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a 
specific target site
