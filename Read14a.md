## the technology industry is not just one of the fastest 
growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the 
world’s dominant commercial culture. And at the core of Silicon

 Valley are certain self-mythologies and dictums: Everything is

different now, data reigns supreme, today’s winners deserve to

triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard yesterday’s

conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.



## Transforms: (Links to an external site.)
With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general 
layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size,
 position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.
## Transitions :
As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
## Animations
 set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, 
 use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name,
  any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
