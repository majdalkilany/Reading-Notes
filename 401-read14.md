# Data Visualization 

### Matplotlib 

matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 

2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data 

from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We 

are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most 

common cases.

####  pyplot


pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib 

object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after 

Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in 

pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important 

commands are explained with interactive examples.

### Visualizing statistical relationships

Statistical analysis is a process of understanding how variables 

in a dataset relate to each other and how those relationships 

depend on other variables. Visualization can be a core component 

of this process because, when data are visualized properly, the 

human visual system can see trends and patterns that indicate a 

relationship.


### Relating variables with scatter plots 


The scatter plot is a mainstay of statistical visualization. It 

depicts the joint distribution of two variables using a cloud of 

points, where each point represents an observation in the 

dataset. This depiction allows the eye to infer a substantial 

amount of information about whether there is any meaningful 

relationship between them.


#### Emphasizing continuity with line plotsÂ¶

Scatter plots are highly effective, but there is no universally 

optimal type of visualisation. Instead, the visual representation 

should be adapted for the specifics of the dataset and to the 

question you are trying to answer with the plot.
