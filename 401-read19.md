# Python Regular Expression

Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of 
characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text 
(string) or not. If you've ever used search engines, search and 
replace tools of word processors and text editors - you've 
already seen regular expressions in use. They are used at the 
server side to validate the format of email addresses or 
passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files 
to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in 
manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data 
science projects involving text mining.

**In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. 
That means that if you want to start using them in your Python 
scripts, you have to import this module with the help of import**

## Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters

The match() function returns a match object if the text matches 
the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None. The re module also 
contains several other functions, and you will learn some of them 
later on in the tutorial.


### Wild Card Characters: Special Characters

With the search function, you scan through the given string/
sequence, looking for the first location where the regular 
expression produces a match.
The group function returns the string matched by the re. You will 
see both these functions in more detail later.

If the character following the backslash is a recognized escape 
character, then the special meaning of the term is taken 
(Scenario 1)
Else if the character following the \ is not a recognized escape 
character, then the \ is treated like any other character and 
passed through (Scenario 2).
\ can be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove their 
special meaning (Scenario 3).


\w - Lowercase 'w'. Matches any single letter, digit, or 
underscore.
\W - Uppercase 'W'. Matches any character not part of \w 
(lowercase w).

\s - Lowercase 's'. Matches a single whitespace character like: 
space, newline, tab, return.
\S - Uppercase 'S'. Matches any character not part of \s 
(lowercase s).


\d - Lowercase d. Matches decimal digit 0-9.
\D - Uppercase d. Matches any character that is not a decimal 
digit.


#### Repetitions : 

It becomes quite tedious if you are looking to find long patterns 
in a sequence. Fortunately, the re module handles repetitions 
using the following special characters:

+ - Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times 
starting from that position.

#### Grouping in Regular Expressions
The group feature of regular expression allows you to pick up 
parts of the matching text. Parts of a regular expression pattern 
bounded by parenthesis () are called groups. The parenthesis does 

not change what the expression matches, but rather forms groups 
within the matched sequence. You have been using the group() 
function all along in this tutorial's examples. The plain match.
group() without any argument is still the whole matched text as 
usual.
