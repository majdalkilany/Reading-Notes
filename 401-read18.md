# Introduction to Cryptography
####  Understanding Ciphers: The Basis of All Cryptography


Cryptography, at its most fundamental level, requires two steps: encryption and decryption. The encryption process uses a cipher in order to encrypt plaintext and turn it into ciphertext. Decryption, on the other hand, applies that same cipher to turn the ciphertext back into plaintext.

example of how this works ::==>>

So our plaintext (message) is “Hello”.

We can now apply one of the simplest forms of encryption known as “Caesar’s Cipher” (also known 
as a shift cipher) to the message.

With this cipher, we simply shift each letter a set number of spaces up or down the alphabet. 

##### A Brief Word on Polymorphism
 Polymorphism is basically a cipher that changes itself with each use. Meaning that each time 
 it is used, it produces a different set of results.
 
  So, if you encrypted the exact same set of 
 data twice, each new encryption would be different from the previous one.

##### Why Does Cryptography Matter

Obfuscation is defined as “The act of making something unclear, obscure, or unintelligible”. It 
means that, in order to transmit a secure message, you must hold back some of the information 
required to understand the message

Which, by default, means it would only take one person with knowledge of the original message 

to divulge the missing pieces to the public.

#### Types of Cryptography : 

1. Hashing :
Hashing is a type of cryptography that changes a message into an unreadable string of text for 

the purpose of verifying the message’s contents, not hiding the message itself

2. Symmetric Cryptography :

Symmetric Cryptography, likely the most traditional form of cryptography, is also the system 
with which you are probably most familiar.  


3. Asymmetric Cryptography

Asymmetric cryptography (as the name suggests) uses two different keys for encryption and 
decryption, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography.

4. Key Exchange Algorithms

Although this particular type of cryptography isn’t particularly applicable for individuals 
outside of the cyber-security realm, I wanted to briefly mention to ensure you have a full 
understanding of the different cryptographic algorithms.
