# Responsive Web Design

**what is responsive webb desighn ?** 

*Responsive web design is the practice of building a website
 suitable to work on every device and every screen size,*

 **Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile**

 Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related,
  and often transposed as one in the same. 
  Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, 
  while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation

 Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a 
 separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users

 **Flexible Layouts**

 Responsive web design is broken down into three main components,
  including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media.
   The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the 
   layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically 
   resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units


  #### Relative Viewport Lengths
CSS3 introduced some new relative length units, specifically related to
 the viewport size of the browser or device. These new units include vw, vh, vmin, and vmax.


**Flexible Grid**

Taking the flexible layout concept, and formula,
 and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a completely dynamic website,
 scaling to every viewport size. 
 For even more control within a flexible layout,
  you can also leverage the min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height properties.

**What is "Float"?**
Float is a CSS positioning property. 
To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout,
 images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed.
  This is commonly and appropriately called "text wrap". Here is an example of that.

There are four valid values for the float property.
 Left and Right float elements those directions respectively. 
 None (the default) ensures the element will not float and Inherit which will assume the float
  value from that elements parent element.


What are floats used for?
Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images,
 floats can be used to create entire web layouts.

**Clearing the Float**

Float's sister property is clear.
 An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent
  to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.
   Again an illustration probably does more good than words do.

Clear has four valid values as well. Both is most commonly used,
 which clears floats coming from either direction. Left and Right can be used to only 
 clear the float from one direction respectively. None is the default,
  which is typically unnecessary unless removing a clear value from a cascade. Inherit
   would be the fifth, but is strangely not supported in Internet Explorer.
    Clearing only the left or right float,
     while less commonly seen in the wild,
      definitely has its uses.

**The Great Collapse**
One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the 
element that contains them (their "parent" element). If this parent element contained
 nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally
 collapse to nothing. This isn't always obvious if the parent doesn't contain any
  visually noticeable background, but it is important to be aware of.
