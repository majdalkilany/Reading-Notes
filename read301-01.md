## Responsive Web Design
These days it is hard to find someone who doesn’t own a mobile device, or multiple, connected to the Internet, and should trends continue mobile Internet usage will surpass that of desktop Internet usage within the year.

So how to build websites suitable for all users?. The industry response to this question has become responsive web design, also known as RWD.

Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

## Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same.

Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change.
Adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change.
A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites.

* Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.

While this does occasionally have its place, it normally isn’t a great idea. Mobile websites can be extremely light but they do come with the dependencies of a new code base and browser sniffing, all of which can become an obstacle for both developers and users.
Responsive web design, favoring design that dynamically adapts to different browser and device viewports, changing layout and content along the way. This solution has the benefits of being all three, responsive, adaptive, and mobile.

* Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media.

## Flexible Layouts
The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

CSS3 introduced some new relative length units, specifically related to the viewport size of the browser or device. These new units include vw, vh, vmin, and vmax.

vw: Viewports width.
vh: Viewports height.
vmin: Minimum of the viewport’s height and width.
vmax: Maximum of the viewport’s height and width.
The formula to help identify the proportions of a flexible layout using relative values is : target ÷ context = result. The formula is based around taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of it’s parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element.

The flexible layout approach alone isn’t enough. At times the width of a browser viewport may be so small that even scaling the the layout proportionally will create columns that are too small to effectively display content. In this event, media queries can be used to help build a better experience.

Media Queries
Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example.

There are a couple different ways to use media queries, using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet, importing a new style sheet using the @import rule, or by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document. Generally speaking it is recommended to use the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests.

Each media query may include a media type followed by one or more expressions. Common media types include all, screen, print, tv, and braille. The HTML5 specification includes new media types, even including 3d-glasses. Should a media type not be specified the media query will default the media type to screen.

The media query expression that follows the media type may include different media features and values, which then allocate to be true or false. When a media feature and value allocate to true, the styles are applied. If the media feature and value allocate to false the styles are ignored.

Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only.

Using the and logical operator within a media query allows an extra condition to be added, making sure that a browser or devices does both a, b, c, and so forth.

The example below selects all media types between 800 and 1024 pixels wide.
@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}
The not logical operator negates the query, specifying any query but the one identified.

In the example below the expression applies to any device that does not have a color screen. Black and white or monochrome screens would apply here for example.
@media not screen and (color) {...}
The only logical operator is a new operator and is not recognized by user agents using the HTML4 algorithm, thus hiding the styles from devices or browsers that don’t support media queries.

Below, the expression selects only screens in a portrait orientation that have a user agent capable of rending media queries.
@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {...}
When using the not and only logical operators the media type may be left off. In this case the media type is defaulted to all.

One popular technique with using media queries is called mobile first. The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

Using the viewport meta tag with either the height or width values will define the height or width of the viewport respectively. Each value accepts either a positive integer or keyword. For the height property the keyword device-height value is accepted, and for the width property the keyword device-width is accepted. Using these keywords will inherit the device’s default height and width value. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

The final, equally important aspect to responsive web design involves flexible media. As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. Doing so ensures that as the viewport gets smaller any media will scale down according to its containers width.

Unfortunately the max-width property doesn’t work well for all instances of media, specifically around iframes and embedded media.

To get embedded media to be fully responsive, the embedded element needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element. The parent element needs to have a width of 100%.

Float
What is "Float"?. Float is a CSS positioning property, just like the images in the print layout where the text flows around them. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page.

This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage, like when the text box in the print layout was told to ignore the page wrap. Absolutely positioned page elements will not affect the position of other elements and other elements will not affect them, whether they touch each other or not.

Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.
