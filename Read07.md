### Tables :
## table represrnt information in grid formate and we do it to organize information to be clear for browsers and do it by table tags .
we add aheading to the row and column by using (th tag).
and we can add aborder and colour to background and in long table we can split the table into (thead ,tbody ,tfoot).
### object :
## creating an object : we should firstly make new object by (boject()) and then creat ablank for object to add prparties and method to it .
we can change the value for element by (object.propartiesName = ‘propartiesValue’)
there is two way to creat object :
creat the object ,then add proparties and method .
creating an object with proparties and method .
this :
## it is akeyword it is used function and object and reach us to function in global scope ,global variabels ,amethod of an object and function expression as method .
if we need to access an item we use an object and if the item is important we use an array .
array actually it is object they hold arelated set of value pairs but the key for each value is its index number .
and there is array of object and object in array .
## ther is atype data revisted in java-script : - simple data type : (string ,number ,boolean ,undifined ,null) - complex data type : (objects)
whenever we have avalue that is number we can use the method and proparties .
the math object has proparties and method for mathmatical constant and function .
