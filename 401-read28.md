# Django Forms

* Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there 
are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data,
 including 
text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on.

* Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, 
as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request 
forgery protection.

* Developers need to write HTML for the form, validate and properly 
sanitize entered data on the server (and possibly also in the browser), 
repost the form with error messages to inform users of any invalid fields, 
handle the data when it has successfully been submitted, and finally 
respond to the user in some way to indicate success.


`<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>

`
* action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when 
the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), 
then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.

* The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in 
a change to the server's database because this can be made more resistant 
to cross-site forgery request attacks.

* The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data 
(e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to 
bookmark or share the URL.

* There are many other types of form fields, which you will largely recognise from their similarity to the equivalent model field classes:
