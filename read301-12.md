# EJS Partials

* Partials are like functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.


* Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.


* Unlike EJS Layouts, EJS partials can work without the express-ejs-layouts module. EJS partials apply in cases like creating objects like header, footer, div.
