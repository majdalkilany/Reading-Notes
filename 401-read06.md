# Random Module
How to use the Random Module in Python ?


**The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.**



 **The Random module contains some very useful functions.**

*  Randint => if we wanted a random integer .

* Choice => Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

* Random => If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

## Risk Analysis .

Why do we use Risk Analysis? ? 
In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas.

 **The perspective of Risk Assessment**

 * Effect – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

 * Cause – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

* Likelihood – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

How to perform Risk Analysis?
There are three steps:

1- Searching the risk

2- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3- Measures for the risk identified
