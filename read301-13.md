# Sending Form Data
* An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

* The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.

*             The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value    must be a valid relative or absolute URL. When specified with no attributes, or If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.

*             The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method.

* The browser sends a request to a URL. An HTTP request consists of two parts: a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities, and a body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request.

### The GET method
* The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.


* The data is appended to the URL as a series of name/value pairs. After the URL web address has ended, we include a question mark (?) followed by the name/value pairs, each one separated by an ampersand (&).


## The POST method

* It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.
## Viewing HTTP requests
* HTTP requests are never displayed to the user (if you want to see them, you need to use tools such as the Firefox Network Monitor or the Chrome Developer Tools).


* The only thing displayed to the user is the URL called. As we mentioned above, with a GET request the user will see the data in their URL bar, but with a POST request they won't. This can be very important for two reasons:

If you need to send a password (or any other sensitive piece of data), never use the GET method or you risk displaying it in the URL bar, which would be very insecure.

If you need to send a large amount of data, the POST method is preferred because some browsers limit the sizes of URLs. In addition, many servers limit the length of URLs they accept.

#### On the server side: retrieving the data

Whichever HTTP method you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs. The way you access this list depends on the development platform you use and on any specific frameworks you may be using with it.

It's more common to use one of the many high quality frameworks that make handling forms easier, such as:

Django for Python (a bit more heavyweight than Flask, but with more tools and options).
Express for Node.js.
Laravel for PHP.
Ruby On Rails for Ruby.
Sending Files
Sending files with HTML forms is a special case. Files are binary data — or considered as such — whereas all other data is text data. Because HTTP is a text protocol, there are special requirements for handling binary data.

The enctype attribute:

This attribute lets you specify the value of the Content-Type HTTP header included in the request generated when the form is submitted. This header is very important because it tells the server what kind of data is being sent. By default, its value is application/x-www-form-urlencoded. In human terms, this means: "This is form data that has been encoded into URL parameters."

If you want to send files, you need to take three extra steps:

Set the method attribute to POST because file content can't be put inside URL parameters.
Set the value of enctype to multipart/form-data because the data will be split into multiple parts, one for each file plus one for the text data included in the form body (if text is also entered into the form).
Include one or more <input type="file"> controls to allow your users to select the file(s) that will be uploaded.

### Security Issues
There are a few rules to keep in mind. The most important rule is: never ever trust your users, including yourself; even a trusted user could have been hijacked.


All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized. Always. No exception.


Escape potentially dangerous characters. all server-side languages have functions for this. Things to watch out for are character sequences that look like executable code (such as JavaScript or SQL commands).


Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary.


Sandbox uploaded files. Store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a completely different domain.
