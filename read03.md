# HTML 
### lists
* Numbered lists
* Bullet lists
* Definition lists

**There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types**

* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms

#### Ordered Lists

* '< ol>' : The ordered list is created with the '< ol>' element.
* '< li>' Each item in the list is placed between an opening '< li>' tag and a closing '< /li>' tag. (The li stands for list item.)

#### Unordered Lists
* '< ul>' : The unordered list is created with the '< ul>' element.
* '< li>' : Each item in the list is placed
between an opening '< li>' tag and a closing '< /li>' tag. (The listands for list item.) 

#### Definition Lists
* '< dl>' : The definition list is created with the '< dl>' element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
 Inside the '< dl>' element you will usually see pairs of '< dt>' and '< dd>' elements.
  
  * '< dt>' : This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
  * '< dd>' : This is used to contain the definition

  ### Boxes

  **At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.**
  
  *You can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:*
* Control the dimensions of your boxes
* Create borders around boxes
*  Set margins and padding for boxes
* Show and hide boxes


**CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it has its own box.**
*You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.*

_You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS._
**It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.**

**Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.**

**Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.**

**CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.**

## javascript
**if .. else statement : we use it to do condition by resolve resolve the condition if it true do the first code and if it false do the second code .**


**switch statement : it same the if statement but instead of resolve a condition match the value with cases and after every case we should do a break and at the end we have adefult choise do it if there is no matches with cases .** 

**for statement : the first thing cheak the condition if it true still repeat it again untell being false it will out frome the loop and we know how many time will repeat .** 


**while statement : it is same for loop but the difference we dont no how many time will repeat the condition .**
