# Dunder (Magic, Special) Methods 

#### What Are Dunder Methods?

In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods that we can use to enrich our classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores

**Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior**


#### Special Methods and the Python Data Model
This elegant design is known as the Python data model and lets developers tap into rich language features like sequences, iteration, operator overloading, attribute access

#### Object Initialization: __init__
Right upon starting my class I already need a special method. To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder:

## What is probability?
An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur.

### From statistics to probability
Our data will be generated by flipping a coin 10 times and counting how many times we get heads
