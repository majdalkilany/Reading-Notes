Javascript Templating - Mustache.js
Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source.

The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.

Example:

Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });
// returns: Hello, Sherlynn

In the above, we see two braces around {{ name }}. This is Mustache syntax to show that it is a placeholder. When Mustache compiles this, it will look for the ‘name’ property in the object we pass in, and replace {{ name }} with the actual value, e,g, “Sherlynn”.
Flexbox
The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).

A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”.
