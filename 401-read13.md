## How to run Linear regression in Python scikit-Learn

**you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn**

### What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.  The overall idea of regression is to examine two things

### Types of Linear Regression 

* Simple linear regression

1 dependent variable (interval or ratio), 1 independent variable (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

* Multiple linear regression

1 dependent variable (interval or ratio) , 2+ independent variables (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

* Logistic regression

1 dependent variable (dichotomous), 2+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)


* Ordinal regression

1 dependent variable (ordinal), 1+ independent variable(s) (nominal or dichotomous)


* Multinomial regression

1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

* Discriminant analysis

1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio)


### When Do You Need Regression?#

Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related


### Problem Formulation

When implementing linear regression of some dependent variable ùë¶ on the set of independent variables







## Scikit-learn 

is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn
