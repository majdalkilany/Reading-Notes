# trees

- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the 
   data structure


- Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree

- Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a     
  root    or node

- Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node


- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node


- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children


- Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of 
   edges from the root to the bottommost node


### Traversals

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing 

a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of 

a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals 

when it comes to trees:

* Depth First
* Breadth First

### Depth First  
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the 

depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to 

carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the 

order in which we search/print the root

* Pre-order: root >> left >> right

* In-order: left >> root >> right

* Post-order: left >> right >> root


**The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion. With these traversals, we rely on the call stack to navigate back up the tree when we have reached the end of a sub-path.**
