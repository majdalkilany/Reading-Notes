# Building the Perfect Team


* A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.

* As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based.

Studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

Psychological Safety Is The secret To Effective Team
Psychological safety is :

* a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up
It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.
Traits of psychological safety:

* conversational turn taking (everyone in the group gets roughly around the same time to speak up)
* average social sensitivity or empathy (the individuals in a group have high average social sensitivity - they can tell when someone in their group is feeling down or is upset).
