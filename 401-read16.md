# Data Science Primer : 

### Chapter 1: Bird's Eye View : 

* **Machine learning is not about algorithms.** 
...and individual algorithms are only one piece of the puzzle. The rest of the puzzle is how you apply them the right way.

#### `What makes machine learning so special? 

M achine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.

#### Key Terminology 

Model - a set of patterns learned from data.

Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.

Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.

Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.

Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.

Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.

Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

#### Machine Learning Tasks

Academic machine learning starts with and focuses on individual algorithms. However, in applied machine learning, you should first pick the right machine learning task for the job.

* A task is a specific objective for your algorithms.

* Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.

In fact, you should always try multiple algorithms because you most likely won't know which one will perform best for your dataset.

#### The 3 Elements of Great Machine Learning

1. A skilled chef (human guidance)
First, even though we are "teaching computers to learn on their own," human guidance plays a huge role.

2. Fresh ingredients (clean, relevant data)
The second essential element is the quality of your data.

3.  Don't overcook it (avoid overfitting)
One of the most dangerous pitfalls in machine learning is overfitting. An overfit model has "memorized" the noise in the training set, instead of learning the true underlying patterns.

### Data Cleaning


Data cleaning is one those things that everyone does but no one really talks about. Sure, it’s not the "sexiest" part of machine learning. And no, there aren’t hidden tricks and secrets to uncover.

However, proper data cleaning can make or break your project. Professional data scientists usually spend a very large portion of their time on this step.

Better data beats fancier algorithms.

In other words... garbage in gets you garbage out. Even if you forget everything else from this course, please remember this point.

In fact, if you have a properly cleaned dataset, even simple algorithms can learn impressive insights from the data!

Obviously, different types of data will require different types of cleaning. However, the systematic approach laid out in this lesson can always serve as a good starting point.
