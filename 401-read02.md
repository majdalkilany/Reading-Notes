# Testing and Modules

### Python Modules and Packages

##### Python Modules: Overview

* There are actually three different ways to define a module in Python:


1- A module can be written in Python itself.
2- module can be written in C and loaded dynamically at run-time, like the re (regular expression) module.
3- A built-in module is intrinsically contained in the interpreter, like the itertools module.

in this sectcion we well focus on the mudule written by python 
All you need to do is create a file that contains legitimate Python code and then give the file a name with a .py extension. That’s it! No special syntax or voodoo is necessary.

##### The Module Search Path

When the interpreter executes like import mode 
  statement . searches for mod.py in a list of directories assembled from the following sources:

The directory from which the input script was run or the current directory if the interpreter is being run interactively

The list of directories contained in the PYTHONPATH environment variable, if it is set. (The format for PYTHONPATH is 

OS-dependent but should mimic the PATH environment variable.)

An installation-dependent list of directories configured at the time Python is installed


## The import Statement
we can import module like this 
IMmport < module name>
 *  Each module has its own private symbol table

 and we can use 
 
 from <module_name> import <name(s)>

## Executing a Module as a Script


Any .py file that contains a module is essentially also a Python script, and there isn’t any reason it can’t be executed like one.

## Python Packages

Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. In the same way that modules help avoid collisions between global variable names, packages help avoid collisions between module names.

Package Initialization

## pytest: helps you write better programs¶

The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.


### Features

* Detailed info on failing assert statements (no need to remember self.assert* names);

* Auto-discovery of test modules and functions;

* Rich plugin architecture, with over 315+ external plugins and thriving community;


## Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.


What is base condition in recursion? In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.
