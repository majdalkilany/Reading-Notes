# SQL

What is SQL
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, also known as queries.

Query constraints are used to filter

discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.

You can order a table by "ORDER BY column"

The LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from.

There is order of execution in the query, for example the highest order that gets executed first is from and join, then where,then group by ... etc till limit/offset

We can insert data into databases we need insert

You can change the value of an already entered information in a database by using update

You can delete rows using DELETE statement.

You can also create entirely new tables using CREATE TABLE
