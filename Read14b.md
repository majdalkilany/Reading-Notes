##### ** What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team **
 our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office
 quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of.
  Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, 
  sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition.
project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. 
Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google.

 For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms
 that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else,

the world’s dominant commercial culture. And at the core of Silicon Valley are certain self-mythologies 
and dictums: Everything is different now, data reigns supreme, today’s winners deserve to triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard yesterday’s conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.
