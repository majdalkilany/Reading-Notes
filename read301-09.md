# Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions:

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
It does not cause any observable side effects.
Examples of observable side effects include modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.
### What's an impure function?!
It uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function.
It reads external files.
Relies on a random number generator.
### Pure functions benefits
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D
#### Immutability
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.


pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
